## Description  

The objective of this challenge is create a portfolio using HTML and CSS:

**User Story**
```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

**Acceptance Criteria**
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Optimizations

- Content scales depending on Viewport Size.
- Desisgned projects that scale based on viewport while also maintaining the AC.
- Refactored code after discovering the inherit property and research into the logic being @media screen.
- List of variables in root so that elements can be adjusted on the fly and can adjust root with different viewport sizes instead of rewiting redunant code.
